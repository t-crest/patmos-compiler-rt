Instructions
------------


To compile the compiler-rt libraries for patmos, go to lib/patmos, and

- (optional) create a config.mk that sets BUILDDIR, and possibly other paths for your local setup
- run make && make install to compile everything and put it next to the patmos-newlib library files


NOTE: The Makefile usage is deprecated and will eventually be removed.
      It was replaced by the new cmake build system, which essentially does the same.
